# Protein_folding
This is the protein folding project for Oxford Summer project, under supervision of Dr.Cris Salvi. 
The works are done by Xingyue Huang and Ruotong Cao

There are 2 main objects we are trying to do:

1. Create a Neural-CDE model to predict protein-folding. 
     The details are written in cde-protein-prediction.ipynb, and the relavent features generation are shown in Feature_generation/generate_feature.ipynb
(Unfinished)

2. Attempt to train a signature inverse model that takes in a signature and return the reconstruction of the path.
     The details are in Signature_inverse_network.ipynb
